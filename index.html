        <p>In my early twenties i had an opportunity to buy the home i grew up in, this in return pushed me to start working on home improvement projects.
        They were disatrous mostly, but i enjoyed it.</p>
        <p>Eventually i sold my home and left to look for pastures greener, four homes later i am now proud to have gained knoledge and experience of several trades although not mastering any in particular,
        these range from plastering and woodwork to tiling and plumbing.  </p>
